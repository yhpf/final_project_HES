				<h2>
					About Womengineer
				</h2>
				<p>
					There is a big problem in todayâ€™s society. Young women do not choose to pursue an engineering degree at university. This is due to lack of knowledge about what these degrees consist of, outdated norms connected to tech, and a perception that it is too difficult.
					This has over the years created a large deficit of female engineers. This is something that the Womengineer foundation wants to change. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					The lack of female engineers is not only an individual problem, it is a problem for the entire society. In addition to the general lack of female engineers, schools, organizations and companies are also without female skills. Less innovations are created when everyone thinks alike, non gender equal companies are less profitable, and the wage gap between men and women never ceases to exist. 
					<br/>
				</p>

				<h3>
					We create places for girls, non-binary and women to Connect 
				</h3>
				<p>
					The primary target group for Womengineer are girls and non-binary at the age of 13-19 years old. In the secondary target group we find women that are already pursuing an engineering degree or women that have completed their degree and that are now working as engineers. We create a difference by getting these target groups to meet. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We connect girls, non-binarya and women through our yearly event  Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day and through Womengineer in general (our website, social media, and our magazine etc.). 
					When we create these connections we make sure to increase the knowledge about tech and engineering. We show good examples and role models. We also try to boost the girls and non-binarys self-confidence in tech, and to remove stereotypes and prejudices around engineers. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					Our Goal
				</h3>
				<p>
					The world will be a better place with more female engineers. For that reason our goal is that in the year of 2030 there will be an equal amount of men and women that graduate in Sweden with an engineering degree. 
				</p>

				<h3 class="un2030">
					We support the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank">UN 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development</a> 
				</h3>
				<p>
					The global Sustainable Development goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015. Womengineer are primarily working to help reach goal #4, #5 and #10.
				</p>
				<h4>
					#4 - Quality Education 
				</h4>
				<p>
					Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
				</p>
				<h4>
					#5 - Gender Equality 
				</h4>
				<p>
					Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
				</p>
				<h4>
					#10 - Reduce Inequality 
				</h4>
				<p>
					Reduce inequality within and among countries
				</p>
				<div class="quote">
					All women working with Womengineer want to close the gender gap in engineering. We believe that gender equality within the engineering profession will benefit both growth and welfare in all countries.
