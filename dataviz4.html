					Data Visualization - The labor market, now and tomorrow 
				</h2>
				<p>
					Trends in the labor market today and in the future are interesting in general. This section looks at the bigger trends for STEM-areas, and will not have a specific focus on girls and women. 
				</p>
				<h3>
					Hard or easy for Employers to hire people with the right skills?
				</h3>
				<p>
					In this section we will look closer on the labor market and the STEM-sectors. Discovering from what College and University programs employers find it easy or hard to find newely grads from, and what needs they see in the future.  
				</p>

						<h4>Hard to find newly graduates</h4>
						<p>
							77 percent of the employers say that they are having a hard time finding teachers grade 7-9 with a focus on mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Employers also find it somewhat hard to find newly graduates with a degress from a Master of Science in Energy and Electronic Engineering and from a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Vehicle Engineering. They also astate that they have a far greater problem finding experiences employees in the same field. 
						</p>
						<h4>Easy to find newly graduates</h4>
						<p>
							Following educational backgrounds employers find it easiest to find newly graduated from. 
							<ul>
							<li>Architect (56 percent)</li>
							<li>Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering (50 percent)</li>
							<li>Master of Science in Electronics, Computer Science and Automation (47 percent)</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h4>Balanced supply and demand of newly graduates</h4>
						<p>
							Newly graduates from programs focusing on biology, physics and chemistry seems to be in balance when it comes to supply and demand.

							<h3>Comment</h3>
							<p>
								Why is there a problem that itâ€™s a deficit of teachers grade 7-9 with a focus on mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry? The last 3 years before High School is crucial to give girls a better understanding of the STEM area. Without inspiring teachers within these subjects we will have an even steeper uphill battle in our pursuit of more female engineering graduates. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Everything start at a young age and that is how we inspire young girls to choose a Natural Science and Technology at High School.
