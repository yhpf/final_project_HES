				<h2>
					Young Women in College and University
				</h2>
				<p>
					The goal for Womengineer is that at least 50% of the Engineering graduates in 2030 should be women. Slowly we are making our way towards that goal. It won’t happen by itself and the progress certainly needs to speed up a bit for the goal to be reached. 
				</p>
				<h3>
					Applicants (first choice) and Admitted to STEM programs
				</h3>
				<p>
					On an aggregated level there are a lot more men than women applying and getting admitted to STEM programs in general. However this differs from field to field. In the fields of Biology, Environmental studies, and Chemistry there are more women than men both applying and getting admitted. Most other fields however are dominated by men. 
					<br/>
					Below we also look at Bachelor of Engineering (Högskoleingenjör) within the field of Technology and Technical Industry and Master of Science in Engineering (Civilingejör) within the field of Technology and Technical Industry.

					<h3>Comment</h3>
					<p>You might notice above that the share of females admitted is greater than the share that applied. Remember that this data represents the first hand choice when applying and the acceptance data represents everyone accepted. So the effect that we can see for women and men at the Bachelor of Engineering (Technology and Technical industry) and Master of Science in Engineering (Technology and Technical industry) is that the women that’s applying tend to be slightly more qualified. That’s why their share is higher in admittance then in first choice applications.

				<h3>
					Graduates with a degree in Master of Science in Engineering
				</h3>
				<p>
					The total number of Engineering graduates has slowly increased. It started off at 1,500 in 1978 and was 4,400 in 2020. However from the beginning of 2000 it seems like the total number is improving slightly slower. One reason to this effect can have its origin in how many open spots the Engineering programs offer each year. For example, in a recession, when the economy is bad and fewer jobs are available the Colleges and Universities tend to get thumbs up from the politics to expand their programs so that more people can attend. We will be looking at the gender ratio to avoid the effect from spots available. That share was for 2019/2020 35 percent women and 65 percent men.

					<h3>Comment</h3>
					<p>Not taken into consideration is whether or not women or men tend to attend and graduate to a greater extent based on the prevailing economic circumstances. Neither has the fact that many engineers never actually graduate, but start working when they are almost done and never feels the need to finish. To learn more about the labor market have a look at the data visualization for <a href="dataviz3.html">Women in the labor force</a> to learn more.</p>
